# OOP_TicTacToe

TO RUN:

I built this in eclipse but included a makefile to try and make this as easy as possible for running outside of it

Run 'make' in the main directory

2 Drivers were included. One manual driver that has user input, and one auto test that hard codes every move for a 2 player game

If you wish to include your own drivers, just include the .java file for them in src/course/oop/main

Once you have ran make, it makes an executable file named run. Just type
'./run className'
where className is the class name of the driver you want to run
For example
'./run TTTDriver'
or
'./run TTTDriver_SampleAutoTest'

Note: The computer player is implemented inside of the driver. It moves randomly and sometimes picks many squares before finding one that is correct

The manual driver has some ASCII art included
